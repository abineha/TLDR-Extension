## Summarization Algorithm

The extension uses a sophisticated extractive summarization approach:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes the input text
2. **Sentence Scoring**: Evaluates sentences based on:
   - Position in text (first/last sentences often important)
   - Word frequency and importance
   - Presence of capitalized words and numbers
   - Sentence length optimization
3. **Selection**: Chooses top-scoring sentences (up to 5 key points)
4. **Ordering**: Maintains original text order for coherence

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (Manifest V3)
- Edge (Chromium-based)
- Other Chromium-based browsers

## Privacy

- No data is sent to external servers
- All processing happens locally in your browser
- Selected text is only stored temporarily in local browser storage
